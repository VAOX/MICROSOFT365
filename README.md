Scripts and other resources to help configure Microsoft 365 

## Exchange Online
</a>For Exchange Online subscriptions hosted in Office 365, start here. Scripts from this guide are located in the Exchange Online folder.

## Setup Intune
</a>: The Intune scripts are (mostly) taken and modified from Microsoft: https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/ ; 
None of the policies will be assigned when you first import the JSON files; simply review, adjust and test the settings out before assigning them. See more details in the "Setup Intune" folder's readme file.

## Windows 10
These scripts are again taken and modified from Microsoft. They are used to install the Windows 10 Business secure configuration profiles (Enhanced security, Corporate security, and High security). Optionally, deployments can include an implementation of Windows Information Protection (MDM/With enrollment).
